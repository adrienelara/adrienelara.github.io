    <div class="content">
        The process by which power is carried (or, delivered)<a class="txtCredit" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_delivery">*</a> from power substations to specific buildings is known as &quot;electric power distribution&quot;. Power is incrementally stepped down from power substations to particular buildings through this process.
        <br/><br/>
        Possibly, electrical power as it is distributed through these poles and wires can be mappable onto a hierarchy structure since it is concentrated (for the concerns of electric power distribution) in substations and then decreased as it is funneled to populaces. Electrical power could also, however, be mapped onto a number of other structural organizations — centralized, decentralized, distributed — with justifiable motivations behind each. Electrical power's distribution, theorized in whatever form, does offer one point that compels attention: imaginings, <a href="materialInstantiations.html">theory</a>, or utility does not cleanly point to <a href="function.html">forms of use</a>.
