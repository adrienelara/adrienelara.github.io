        Their <a href="structure.html">structural</a> engineering and creation, while based on their function and utility, does not encompass all the ways in which these poles are used. Many utility poles not fit cleanly within <a href="categories.html">categories</a> of &quot;joint pole&quot; or a respective utility and pole.

        <br/><br/>
        Additionally, utility poles, like streetlights and other pedestrian column infrastructures, are often plastered and stapled with FOR RENT and LOST DOG signs among other neighborhood paraphernalia. As Neal McLain notes, these are technically &quot;unauthorized&quot; since utility poles as well as their respective wires, cables, and lines are privately owned.<a class="txtCredit" href="http://www.annsgarden.com/poles/poles.htm#una">*</a>
