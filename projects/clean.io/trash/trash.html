        <p>Welcome to the trash bin of Clean.io, the clean design initiative of the World White Web. This trash bin is an interface created to act as a waste receptacle for the interface of Clean.io.</p>
        
        <p>Clean.io is a contemporized extension of the first website on the internet: <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">CERN's website for the World Wide Web project</a>. The website introduces the World Wide Web. The structure of the site follows a loose nuclear network model in which there is a centralized homepage through which sub-nodes can be reached. Most of the sub-nodes (and the pages that branch from those nodes) link back to this homepage.</p>
        
        <p>Clean.io captures CERN's World Wide Web in the 21st century. Through reconfiguring the elements of CERN's World Wide Web website, Clean.io extends the project of modernization and optimizes it for the contemporary web. Rather than introducing the structural fantasies of the web, Clean.io brings forward design trends and templates of and for web use. Its trademark structural feature is its consolidation of the W3 website's hyperlinked structure into one simple page for easier, faster browsing. If "the most profound technologies are those that disappear,"<sup><a href="workscited.html#weiser" target="_blank">[3, p.94]</a></sup> Clean.io is the ultimate technological interface with its spacious white background, seamless transitions, and simple design.</p>
        
        <p>What is, however, left unconsidered and discarded? If 'clean design' is the inclination for contemporary designers, then cleanliness as a concept must be considered to understand the ramifications of design. Both cleanliness and the contemporary interface lend themselves to each other as they are both pinnacle goals of projects of whiteness and modernization. Cleanliness is defined through a successful elimination of trash, and similarly the interface "defines its own interiority in exclusion of its bounding entities."<sup><a href="workscited.html#hookway" target="_blank">[1, p.11]</a></sup> This is the current trajectory of design, the process and architecture through which control is configured online.</p>
        
        <p>The trash bin allows for an interrogation of the decisions and gestures of Clean.io â€” of what political labor has been made intangible through good design; of what has been rejected and relegated to ugliness; of what messiness has been condensed into lines of computation.</p>
