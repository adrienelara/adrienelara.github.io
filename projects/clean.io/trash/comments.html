                <p>Following Branden Hookway's theories in <i>Interface</i>, the interface serves and encompasses a number of functions including creating a space for relational encounters, determining the limits of the human and the technology, and bounding the conditions within which interactions may occur. The displayed web is the most readily sensed interface, but it rests on networks of various others.</p>
                <p>Within the web, websites are coded in the languages HTML and CSS in addition to several other languages that are web-based. The code comprised of these languages is considered the backend of a website. Interfacing occurs in multiple areas here already. While the first is between the human's and computer's faces, there is another between the display and the code, then another between the code and the browser, then another the computer's own programming.</p>
                <p>What is not readily sensed but is overwhelming and palpable are the established cultural interfaces upon which these languages rely. The "charset=UTF-8" code here signals for the character set of the website to be in UTF-8, an encoding which allows for all digital characters to be available for use on the website. This instance of interface &quot;capacity,&quot;<sup><a href="workscited.html#hookway" target="_blank">[1, p.5]</a></sup> as emphasized in <i>Interface</i>, both establishes and relies upon crucial boundaries within which the contemporary web is enmeshed.</p>
                <p>Although the displayed interface may have the capacity to be written in a number of languages and their respective characters, the code upon which any website relies is still based off of English. With keywords such as &quot;head,&quot; &quot;link&quot; &quot;body,&quot; &quot;anchor,&quot; and the acronym of &quot;HTML&quot; standing itself for the English phrase &quot;Hypertext Markup Language,&quot; the displayed interface boasts a capacity that its backend does not have.</p>

                <p>A seminal text on cyber and technosocial studies, <i>Cybertypes</i> by Lisa Nakamura confronts the seeming body-lessness of the internet and how race can be configured along digital lines. The text asserts that the way race is assembled on the internet relies, in fact, on the strong body-ness of the internet. While bodies are not fleshy as they are 'offline', they exist still as the internet anchors itself through the concept of the body, whether through tick boxes for race selections or MMO avatars. As quoted in <i>Cybertypes</i>, Allucquère Rosanne Stone in &quot;Will the real body please stand up?: boundary stories about virtual cultures&quot; states, &quot;Even in the age of the techno social subject, life is lived through bodies.&quot;<sup><a href="workscited.html#nakamura" target="_blank">[2, p.115]</a></sup></p>
                <p>This extends even to the web's framework of HTML, which relies on a base structure of the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt;, the head being where metadata and links that do not visually appear on the page are placed and the body where the webpage's displayed interface is laid out.</p>
                <p>Such a body, although seemingly empty prior to being coded by its maker, is already predisposed to certain defaults, including a white background, black foreground text, and blue underlined links. The bodily envelope that webpages assume are already pre-configured even beyond these defaults as well, by hardware presets and <a href="#html_5">linguistic limitations of code</a>. The interface body is created through such boundarying of possibilities and it is only within and after that boundarying that design can take place. As per Branden Hookway's <i>Interface</i>, the interface &quot;delimits the space for a kind of inhabitation and opens up otherwise unavailable phenomena, conditions, situations, and territories for exploration, use, participation, and exploitation.&quot;<sup><a href="workscited.html#hookway" target="_blank">[1, p.5]</a></sup></p>

                <p>With <i>home</i>pages, web<i>sites</i>, and <i>site maps</i>, the internet as a realm is defined by its territories as well as its territorialization. The utopic fantasy of the internet depends on the internet as a world comprised of locations, cleansed from statehood. The subjects it creates (&quot;users&quot;) are also rinsed and wrung dry of any political positionings, placed instead into the world of the web where territories can somehow exist without geopolitics.</p>
                <p>And yet, near-unbounded travel (since the internet, too, is still bounded in terms of travel possibilities) already existed prior to the internet in the form of tourism. From this, Lisa Nakamura in <i>Cybertypes</i> draws the concept of cybertourism, in which movable First World subjects mimick the gestures of tourism with even greater ease through cyberspace. Nakamura connects travel and cyberspace traversal by stating that &quot;they situate [the &quot;industrialized First World subject&quot;] in the position of the one who looks, the one who has access, the one who communicates.&quot;<sup><a href="workscited.html#nakamura" target="_blank">[2, p.89]</a></sup></p>
                <p>'Welcome' and 'enter' buttons then, too, are decisions already bounded by and fraught with political debris. They expect a certain user to turn user-subject upon entrance to a site.</p>

                <p>In &quot;Computer for the 21st Century,&quot; Mark Weiser describes the compression of technology into singular objects as a form of streamlining the disappearance of technology into &quot;the background.&quot;<sup><a href="workscited.html#weiser" target="_blank">[3, p.95]</a></sup> The design of Clean.io and much of 'clean design' in general also supports this consolidation — specifically to this analysis, of several pages into one sectioned page.</p>
                <p>Referring back to Clean.io's predecessor of <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">CERN's World Wide Web website</a>, the W3 site emphasizes and explores the then-new possibility of hyperlinking. The links are sometimes integrated into the text itself and the bottom section of the landing page echoes as a prototype of what is now a navigation bar.</p>
                <p>Clean.io and its contemporaries, however, opt instead for a single-page layout where content is sectioned off rather than distributed over several pages.</p>
                <p>One possible motivation for this compression draws from Weiser's explanations of how motors 'disappeared': consolidation makes for &quot;[c]heap, small, efficient&quot;<sup><a href="workscited.html#weiser" target="_blank">[3, p.95]</a></sup> commodities that are easily manufactured. Although websites do not need to be manufactured (at least, not directly by humans in factories), single pages may draw from the same reasoning. Given that servers and internet cables are limited in capacity, compressing data is a staple of the web. Design has followed suit.</p>
                <p>However, single pages must also be able to handle an abundance of content being loaded simultaneously rather than dispersed throughout various pages. What the loading of a single-page, sectioned, content-rich website signals is that (1) a user's computer is able to handle the bombardment (and the user must therefore have the means to adequate internet access and respective servers), and that (2) a website's owners or owning corporation is able to pay for hosting fees for an adequate server. The more on the page, and the lesser the pages, the richer.</p>

                <p>As <a href="#html_80">consolidation</a> has become a major tenet of contemporary web design and contributed to the 'disappearance' of the web into the 'background', margins and paddings of websites are increasingly decreased or eliminated. Margins and paddings create space between and within the edges of elements, and many browsers set a website's general margins and paddings to several pixels.</p>
                <p><a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">CERN's World Wide Web website</a>, for example, was created prior to the existence of Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) which allow for the management of a website's appearance including margins and padding. The website thus does not have coded margin or padding sizes, but its text still is distanced from the edges of the browser window.</p>
                <p>Setting a website's general margins and paddings to zero is an attempt at boundarilessness for the interface itself. If the interface is as Branden Hookway describes in <i>Interface</i> — defined by the &quot;delimited field&quot;<sup><a href="workscited.html#hookway" target="_blank">[1, p.9]</a></sup> it creates — and such delimitation attempts to eliminate itself, the power relations it boundaries become more seamless, or in Mark Weiser's terms, &quot;invisible.&quot;<sup><a href="workscited.html#hookway" target="_blank">[3, p.94]</a></sup></p>

                <p>The case of the white background is particularly fraught with pre-configurations of the web. A default white background, as functioning in <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">CERN's World Wide Web website</a> and as coded in line 7 of Clean.io's CSS, is crucial to technological disappearance, consolidation, and cleanliness.</p>
                <p>A white background allows for seamless (to use Mark Weiser's term) &quot;disappearance&quot; since it blends without boundary into a white world.

                <p>h1 is a preset, special style for headers in HTML/CSS. There are a number of these preset styles which are not necessary to use to make a website and its interface, but are provided within the language regardless. Contained within HTML/CSS as the languages of the web interface, h1 is a relational entity that allows users to establish a relationship with a webpage.

                <p>Like the landscape, stretched background images set to &quot;cover&quot; in CSS align with ongoing neoliberal occupations with breadth, vastness, and width. With a background image filling the entire screen, as is often done in contemporary 'clean' web designs, the interface carries out two major functions of creating a seamlessness within which to 'disappear' and also creates a contained world in which the user is subject to various configurations of control.</p>
                <p>The wide, landscape-like background thus doubles the power potential of the interface. As stated in Branden Hookway's <i>Interface</i>, &quot;control implicitly seeks out the interface as underdeveloped territory to be explored and colonized&quot;<sup><a href="workscited.html#hookway" target="_blank">[1, p.11]</a></sup>. For contemporary 'clean' design, the interface itself is a neocolonial technology — all-encompassing, boundariless, infinite.</p>

                <p>Almost all elements on Clean.io are bounded by heights and widths in either &quot;vw,&quot; &quot;vh,&quot; or &quot;%&quot; units. Respectively, these units are in direct relation to window width (vw), window height (vh), or size of the parent element (%). They are, similarly to <a href="css_39">transitions</a>, relatively new in CSS whereas earlier designs relied on absolute units such as pixels. These new units allow for a website to be 'responsive'.</p>
                <p>Contemporary web designs are often marked by 'responsiveness', a web trait that describes a webpage's elements changing in size (and, often, position as well) according to the size of their bounding window as well as the device accessing the site. In short, the interface 'responds' to the user. The webpage's contents are, thus, no longer static and are instead dependent on the user.</p>
                <p>Calling back to <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">CERN's World Wide Web website</a>, the web is now no longer only 'universally accessible' but succumbs to the individual whims of the user-verse. It is connected to but distant from utopic assemblings of the early internet, in which &quot;there are no infirmities, no gender, no age—'only minds.'&quot;<sup><a href="workscited.html#nakamura" target="_blank">[2, p.87]</a></sup> There is, instead, a hyperunderstanding of the 'individual', the subject, the user. The user is now hyperindividual.</p>
                <p>Such dynamism is easily placeable in a contemporary technosocial-scape in which 'diversity' and 'inclusivity' are at the forefront, key to understanding contemporary utopic fantasies. Responsive design is also, because of this, concerning. If the interface is now dynamic; and seems to understand every contour of its user; and this is 'responsiveness'; and this is what communication now <i>is</i> between the user and interface, then the interface's capacity for power is only amplified. As neoliberalism functions to enlist those with 'diversity' markers into capitalist regimes, it even further displaces the existence of exploitation. Responsive web comes inextricably from this genealogy.</p>
